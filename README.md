About My Task:

  This project was developed as part of the CODTECH Software Development Internship – Task 1, where the goal was to create a fully functional static portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim of this task is to help beginners understand the essentials of building a professional website, organizing content effectively, applying responsive styling, and implementing basic JavaScript interactions. This portfolio serves as a personal web presence showcasing my details, skills, projects, and ways to contact me.

🔹 Project Objective

The primary objective of this task is to design and develop a clean and responsive developer portfolio that demonstrates foundational front-end development skills. The website is structured to highlight important sections such as an introduction, background, technical skills, past projects, and a contact form. Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in using HTML for structure, CSS for design and responsiveness, and JavaScript for dynamic features.

🔹 Website Structure

The website is built using semantically organized HTML5, ensuring readability and accessibility. It contains five main sections:

Home Section (Hero Area):
Introduces the developer with a prominent heading, a short description, and call-to-action buttons. This section creates the first impression and gives visitors immediate insight into who I am.

About Section:
Includes a brief personal introduction, educational background, and tools I am familiar with. Information cards make this section visually appealing and easy to read.

Skills Section:
Showcases various technical skills using progress bars. This helps viewers quickly understand my strengths in different technologies.

Projects Section:
Displays my work through interactive project cards. Clicking on a card opens a JavaScript-powered modal popup showing more details and images related to the project.

Contact Section:
A simple contact form where visitors can enter their name, email, and message. JavaScript validates the inputs before submission.

🔹 JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity across the website. Key functionalities include:

Mobile navigation toggle for smaller screens

Modal popup for viewing project details

Form validation to ensure users enter required information

Automatically updating footer year

These features showcase a practical understanding of DOM manipulation, events, and basic scripting.

🔹 Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries. It adjusts correctly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. A hamburger menu appears on smaller screen widths to improve navigation on mobile devices. This ensures the portfolio delivers a smooth user experience across all device types.

🔹 Outcome and Learning

Completing this task helped me strengthen my core front-end development skills. I learned how to structure web pages effectively, apply modern styling practices, work with responsive layouts, and introduce interactive elements using JavaScript. This portfolio forms the foundation for future web development projects and demonstrates my ability to create clean, functional, and user-friendly interfaces.
